# Frisbee golf points counter

Keeps track of the number of throws for the whole group when you progress the disc golf course. The stack is React + Node.js + Express + MongoDB. There are two frontends available: normal browser frontend and react native frontend to be used with mobile phones.

## Installing and running the app locally

Node.js is required to run the app.

Clone the repository 

Run npm install in each of the directories: backend, frontend and reactnative.

The backend is run in its folder with: npm run watch

The frotend is run in its folder with: npm start

React native frontend is run in its folder with: npm start

## Live demo

Not available at the moment.

## Some remaining issues

Bad mobile phone connection might cause some unresponsivness when storing the points to the backend database because the app tries to keep in sync with the database.

There is no signup system at the moment.

The look and feel of the frontends are very basic and would require more work if the app would be made open to public.

Testing is very basic.
